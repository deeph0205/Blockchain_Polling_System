# Blockchain_Polling_System

The goal of this assignment is to create multiple polls for different users and show the winner choice of a given poll. The following file is saved in .sol extension and runs on remix IDE on the browser.


How I planned on approaching this task:

1) My first goal is to create ways to have multiple users and polls exist on the smart contract. (Done)

2) Is to have interaction possible between users and polls choices to display winning choice for a given poll. (Done)  
      Multiple users can now poll on any given poll by giving correct poll number and their choice number, the maximum of count is later displayed.

3) Work on setting the periods when users can vote on a poll to handle the edge cases.
